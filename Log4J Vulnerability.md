# Log4J Vulnerability — 

It's similar to `SQL Injection`

There also exists something called `Log Injection`, which jsut adds malicious logs, for ex: error in transaction, please refund the dollars  

so, user credential could be compromised through the application's dependencies,  
for ex: stealing access_key_id & secret_key from lambda' environment etc.  
hence, better beware of the unauthentic dependency, always use authorized ones, like from apache, bsd licensed etc.  

To resolve the above vulnerability —  
1. upgrade the log4j version to 2.16 or the latest one
2. patch the log4j class directly the classpath, so that the application will always refer the patched class file,  
rather than referring to the class that are coming through dependencies
